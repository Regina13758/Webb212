                Tbsp. soy sauce
                ASSEMBLY
                1
                
                head Napa cabbage
                Nonstick cooking oil spray
                SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
                A 1"-diameter wooden dowel, a bench scraper, a ruler (optional); a bamboo steamer
                Preparation
                SOUP
                Step 1
                Place pork skin in a small stockpot or large saucepan and add cold water to cover. Bring to a 
                boil; drain and rinse with cold water. Slice skin lengthwise into 1"-wide strips, trimming any 
                fat, then slice strips crosswise into about ¼"-wide pieces. Return skin to same stockpot and 
                add bones, foot, scallions, ginger, wine, and 8 cups cold water. Bring to a boil, skim surface 
                of any foam, and reduce heat. Simmer, skimming often, until liquid is almost opaque and reduced
                 to 2 cups, 60 75 minutes. 
                 Step 2
                 Strain liquid into a 13x9" baking dish; discard solids. Season with salt and chill until set, 
                 at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. If making ahead, cover soup with plastic wrap once jelled.

                 
                 FILLING
                 Step 3
                 Mix ground pork, scallions, garlic, soy sauce, salt, wine, sugar, oil, ginger, and pepper 
                 with chopsticks in a medium bowl, stirring in one direction until it all comes together and a 
                 light film forms on the sides of bowl, about 20 seconds.
                 Step 4
                 Cut a fine crosshatch pattern in jelled soup to create very small pieces (about ⅛" squares). 
                 Scrape into bowl with filling and mix to combine. Cover and chill until ready to use.

                 DOUGH
                 Step 5
                 Place 3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Slowly drizzle in 1 cup very hot tap water, mixing 
                 constantly with chopsticks or a fork, until dough starts to hold together in shaggy pieces. 
                 Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rest 15 minutes (this allows flour to hydrate).</p>
