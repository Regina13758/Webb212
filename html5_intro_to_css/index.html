    <h2>Information About Greenhouse</h2>

    
        <p>Greenhouse gardening means cultivating vegetables or flowering plants in a controlled, enclosed 
    environment that extends the growing season and protects against pests.Built from plastic, plexiglass or 
    glass, a basic greenhouse turns sunlight into heat while protecting plants from pests, disease and weather 
    extremes. In a greenhouse, the gardener creates the ideal environment for their plants. They can adjust the
   temperature, control humidity, provide shade as needed and experiment with different soils and fertilizers.</p>

    <h3>What To Consider When Greenhouse Gardening</h3>
    <img src="images/global-warming.png" alt="world">

    <p>Greenhouse gardening is rarely as simple as tossing up a structure and bringing in plants. 
    “In most climates,” says Hachadourian, “a greenhouse will require electricity, water, and heat sources, 
    especially if the plants that you cultivate require heat to survive cold winters.” Cultivating heat in 
    a glass or plastic room is typically the easy part. The equipment you install determines how you control 
    the environment.Commitment: How committed are you to the year-round chores of greenhouse gardening? One 
    major difference between seasonal and greenhouse gardening, Hachadourian says, “is that Mother Nature is 
    no longer caring for the plants inside a greenhouse — the gardener is now responsible for their watering, 
    care and financial support!”</p>
