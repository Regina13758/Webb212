        <h3>Growing Zones</h3>
        <p>The Hardiness Zone Map is a valuable tool but it is not foolproof. There are a variety of factors 
            that can influence the hardiness of a given plant in a garden. These factors include: soil type, 
            drainage, snow cover, exposure to wind, winter, rainfall (or lack of), as well as fluctuations in 
            temperature.</p>
