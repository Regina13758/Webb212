        <p>Zone Hardiness
            The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has devised a system to provide gardeners 
            with a basic guide to plant hardiness  how much winter cold a plant can withstand. The Hardiness 
            Zone Map system divides the United States and Canada into numbered zones based on lowest average 
            winter temperature. Even within a zone, different micro-climates exist, such as large urban areas 
            which may be warmer or land situated at different elevations.
            
            What effects plant hardiness
            The Hardiness Zone Map is a valuable tool but it is not foolproof. There are a variety of factors 
            that can influence the hardiness of a given plant in a garden. These factors include: soil type, 
            drainage, snow cover, exposure to wind, winter, rainfall (or lack of), as well as fluctuations 
            in temperature.</p>
