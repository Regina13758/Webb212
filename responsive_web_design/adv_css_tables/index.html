            <h2>Welcome to Cooking Fun</h2>
            <p>There is nothing like cooking projects to focus the mind and put idle hands to work. Whether 
            it is throwing together a few big-batch recipes to set you up for the week or taking your time 
            through one steppy, complicated dessert, following a recipe is one of our favorite ways to channel 
            our energy into one time- and attention-hogging task. The one thing that makes it better than 
            binge-watching an entire season of that show you heard about on Twitter? There is actually something
            to show for it at the end. Whether you are in the mood for a deeply comforting moussaka, a big 
            flavor black-and-white concha, or a mesmerizingly beautiful squash and caramelized onion tart, 
            these are the cooking projects to dive into when what you really want is something to do.</p>

            <p>There's an art to eating pork soup dumplings: Nibble a bite, cautiously slurp the soup, then 
            eat the rest. A hearty thanks to Pamela Lau, the talented home cook (and mom of our former staff 
            photographer, Alex Lau!) who generously shared her proportions for the dough, soup, and filling to 
            help us create this recipe. Without Pamela's patient demonstration of her folding technique via 
            Skype, our soup dumplings would not have had the requisite 18 pleats! </p>
