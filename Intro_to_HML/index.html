<h2>Wellcome to my Website</h2>
<p>I love birds in general. Hummingbirds are my favorite for I think they are very majestic.
    The picture is of Blue and Gold Macaws another favorite of mine. I belive every bird has its own unique
    trates. Every coler and sound a bird has their is a purpose for it.

<p>Several years back I used to rais birds for the zoo. I would also help with breeding conservation programs.
    My favorite thing was when we would do releses back in to the wild where they came from. It is a great
    feeling to help all of our birds stay off the endangered list.</p>
